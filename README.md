# PandaFit

PandaFit is a multiplatform app that helps you achieve your optimal health by giving you a motivation to get moving. It collects data from your Fitbit or Apple Healthkit to evaluate how close you have gotten to your optimal step count. 

##Your Personal Panda
PandaFit starts with your personal Panda - you can name it and select one of three fitness levels to determine the amount of steps you have to take each day to keep your Panda happy.

The Panda starts with a happiness score of 50, making it content. However it looses happiness over the day - you have to get moving to gain points and make your panda happy! You can see the status of your Panda on your Pebble, Apple Watch or iPhone.
